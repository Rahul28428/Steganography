# Steganography
Steganography (semagram-based steganography) is a technique used to hide a secret message (image file) into a text-based file (word or rtf file).

The repository contains two files, namely text.txt and image.jpeg. By leveraging the technique of steganography, the image.jpeg file is concealed within the text.txt file. When the code provided in the code.ipynb notebook is executed, it generates a file named output_B20CS047.docx. This resulting file serves as the hidden image file, revealing the image when the font size is adjusted to 1 pixel.

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data, such as images, text, or audio files, without arousing suspicion. In this case, the image.jpeg file is embedded within the text.txt file, allowing the image to be hidden in plain sight. The code.ipynb notebook contains the necessary instructions and algorithms to perform this concealment.

This approach of hiding images within text files using steganography provides a discreet and inconspicuous means of transmitting sensitive information or secret imagery. It demonstrates the potential for covert communication by leveraging the characteristics of different file formats and exploiting the human perception limitations at extremely small font sizes.
